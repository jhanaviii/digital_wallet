## üß™ Testing

A Postman collection is available in the `docs` directory for testing all API endpoints.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Database Schema

The system uses the following database tables:

- `profiles`: User profile information
- `wallets`: User wallets with balance and currency
- `transactions`: Record of all financial transactions
- `fraud_flags`: Detected suspicious activities

## üîí Security Features

1. **Row Level Security (RLS)**
   - Users can only access their own data
   - Admins have special access policies

2. **JWT Authentication**
   - All endpoints (except public ones) require valid JWT tokens

3. **Atomic Transactions**
   - Database functions ensure data integrity

4. **Input Validation**
   - All API inputs are validated before processing

## üìä Bonus Features

### Scheduled Jobs

A daily fraud scan runs automatically at 1:00 AM UTC to detect suspicious patterns across all transactions from the previous day.

### Soft Delete

Transactions are never physically deleted from the database. Instead, they are marked with the `is_deleted` flag, maintaining a complete audit trail.
